# ✨ Anshika’s DSA Journey✨
Welcome to my little corner of code! 💻 This repository is a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I, Anshika, have been solving as part of my learning journey in Java. From basic logic to tricky challenges, this repo reflects my growth as a programmer and a student of computer science. 🌱✨

## 👩‍🎓 About Me
Hi! I'm Anshika, currently pursuing my BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) and always curious about how things work behind the scenes in programming. 🔍 I'm passionate about problem-solving, building strong foundations in DSA, and preparing for coding interviews.

This GitHub repo is a space where I’m documenting all the DSA questions I solve — organized topic-wise, explained clearly, and written in clean Java code. Whether you're new to coding or brushing up on old concepts, feel free to explore and learn along with me! 🌟
